I just watched the [talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/linus_torvalds_the_mind_behind_linux)
Linus Torvalds gave in February 2016 at a TED event. He is most famous as the
creator of Linux. Torvalds talked about the idea behind Git, which he also
initiated, how it allows people to work collaboratively, and sometimes to take a
common project in quite different directions in accord with their varied goals.

Torvalds also discusses his sense of good taste in code (using an example of a
[singly-linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list#Singly_linked_linear_lists_vs._other_lists)),
recognizing big patterns to reveal apparently special cases as part of the
larger normal case (a more detailed explanation of his example can be found
[here](http://grisha.org/blog/2013/04/02/linus-on-understanding-pointers/)).
