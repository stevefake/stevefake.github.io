sandi metz - first one; want better apps?

writing better objected code: "make smaller things" (classes, methods, etc)

the gilded rose kata
43 line if statement
"boolean impaired"

"squint test" looking for changes in shape and color
  shape - nested conditionals mean hard to follow reasoning
  color -

the pattern failed me
  trying to make a minor edit to an existing unwieldy pattern

"tests are the wall at your back"

reorganized refacotr the broken pattern

clever should not be "not smart or clever"

well written code makes patterns readily apparent

"duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction"

flag dups for yourself if you like to try to fix later

"small methods are simple"

the shape is flat and the colors are clustered

intermediate refactorings can get more complex first before arriving at the simpler end point. that's okay if you know where you're going.

open for extension
closed for modification
oo principles - a style guide for arranging code

ideally should be able to add new behavior w/out adding code

foo ?

codesmell type middleman

inheritance is fine as long as the hierarchy is shallow and narrow
shallow narrow subclasses at the leaf nodes

write code that can adapt to the future

"make the change easy, this might be hard"

"refactor through complexity"
